Python Interface Engine
This series of scripts is written to demonstrate the usage of the Python Library module tkinter - Python interface to Tcl/Tk. 
The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. 
Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems. 
(Tk itself is not part of Python; it is maintained at ActiveState.)
